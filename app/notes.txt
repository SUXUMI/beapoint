    sometimes appears the warning message:
    `[Unhandled promise rejection: Error: Native splash screen is already hidden. Call this method before rendering any view.]`

    `borderStyle: "dashed",` >> reises error on <Image /> despite documentation https://reactnative.dev/docs/view-style-props#borderstyle
    `borderStyle: "dotted",` >> reises error on <Image /> BUT draws "dotted" style
        Warning: Failed prop type: Invalid props.style key `borderStyle` supplied to `Image`.

QUESTIONS
    how about localization???

    statless function VS classes??

    onBlur / onFocus - not works! Why?

    what to do when keyboard pops up?
    
    `changeHandler` console.log(values) are still in previous state?
        re-rendering time, useState is async AND without the promise! (no await!!!)
    
    navigation header image background?
